Step2: DEG analysis
  it appears that the last variable in the design formula, 'group_list',
  has a factor level, 'control', which is not the reference level. we recommend
  to use factor(...,levels=...) or relevel() to set this as the reference level
  before proceeding. for more information, please see the 'Note on factor levels'
  in vignette('DESeq2').

Warning message:
In fgseaMultilevel(...) :
  For some pathways, in reality P-values are less than 1e-10. You can set the `eps` argument to zero for better estimation.
